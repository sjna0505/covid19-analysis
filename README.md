# covid19-analysis

Here I'd like to show a universal properity of covid19 spread across all countries
The property can be found when we plot cumulative confirmed cases vs. daily confirmed case increase on a log-log scale
I can show all countries follow the same slope
and the graph clearly shows the countries who had successfully contained the spread

the default run of the script with the parameter 'time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv' which is copied from 'https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/' would create covid19.png 

Looking at the graph created on 04/05/2020, all lines are universally trending, but there are two downward exceptions which are 'KOREA, SOUTH' and 'CHINA'. Both of them successfully contained the spread
The upward exception is 'US' still in the middle of exponential spread

haha
